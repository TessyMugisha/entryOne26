Build a responsive interactive website for my project called EntryOne. The website must feel like a real journal/book that starts closed and then opens. Use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks). Keep it lightweight and easy to edit.

Design + Mood

Calm, editorial, journal-like. Not a modern SaaS landing page.

Colors: off-white/cream background, charcoal text, subtle accent (muted blue or olive).

Typography: clean and readable, with an editorial feel (use Google Fonts like Playfair Display for headings and Inter or Source Sans 3 for body).

Add subtle paper texture or grain (CSS background pattern is fine, do not rely on heavy images).

Avoid bright colors, gradients, or flashy animations.

Page 1: Closed Journal Landing (the “cover”)

First screen shows a closed black/dark journal centered on the page, similar to a Moleskine notebook.

The journal cover has minimal text centered:

Title: “EntryOne”

Subtitle: “A living archive of beginnings”

Include a primary button: “Open the Journal”

Add subtle details to make it feel real: rounded corners, slight shadow, and an elastic band on the right side (like a notebook strap).

When user clicks “Open the Journal”:

Animate the journal opening (simple but elegant). Use CSS transforms + JS: the cover “swings” open, then transition to the next view.

After animation, reveal the Archive homepage view.

Page 2: Archive Homepage (Archive Box / Folder Tabs)

After opening, show an archive-style layout:

Top navigation designed like folder tabs (not a normal navbar).

Tabs: Archive, About, Mission, Contribute.

The main content area should look like an archive box/index cards:

Cards for entries (title + small metadata + tag).

Each card has: Name, Role/Context, Category tag (Beginning/Pivot/Quiet Win), and a button “Open Entry”.

Clicking an entry opens a link (use placeholder Notion URLs for now).

Add a search bar and a simple filter dropdown for tags (front-end filtering only).

Field Journal Entry Visual Motifs (like the open journal photo)

Inside the Archive view, add a “Featured Spread” section that visually references:

a letter envelope on the left page (a rectangle card that looks like an envelope)

a polaroid card on the right page (photo placeholder with tape style at top)

small caption text like “letter to your future self” and “polaroid of yourself at the moment”
This section can be static (no actual images needed), but should mimic the layout and feel.

Content Requirements

Include sample entries (3–6) in a JS array with fields:

id, title, personName, role, category, notionUrl, date

Generate the entry cards dynamically from this data.

Make it easy to add more entries by editing the array.

Interaction Requirements

Smooth transitions between “cover” and “archive” views.

Support keyboard accessibility:

Enter key opens the journal when button is focused.

Mobile responsive:

On mobile, the journal cover scales, tabs become scrollable, archive cards stack.

Deliverables

Provide index.html, styles.css, script.js.

Clean, well-commented code.

No build step required (just run as a static site).

Include instructions in comments at the top of script.js on how to add new entries.

Name the project “EntryOne Journal Archive”.
