Update my existing EntryOne website project. Keep it HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks). The goal is a cohesive, journal-first experience with an archive that feels like it lives inside the journal, not like a separate website.

Core UX Fixes (Important)

The closed journal cover must feel big and weighty:

Journal cover should fill 60–70% of the viewport (taller and wider than now).

Reduce extra whitespace around it.

It must not feel like a small thumbnail.

When “Open the Journal” is clicked, the transition should feel like a reveal, not a page jump:

Animate the cover opening using CSS transforms.

While opening, fade/expand the archive content as if it appears from inside the journal.

Keep background consistent (paper/cream texture) so it feels continuous.

Brand + Color System (Very Important)

Unify the entire site under a restrained palette:

Primary background: warm cream/off-white

Text: charcoal/near-black

One subtle accent color maximum (muted olive OR muted blue OR warm ink-brown).
Remove the current multi-color feel.

Category pills must NOT be green/blue/tan.
Replace category tags with monochrome labels:

Outlined pill with charcoal border, or

Small caps tag text (BEGINNING / PIVOT / QUIET WIN)
Use typography and border, not multiple colors.

Typography

Use editorial typography:

Headings: serif (e.g., Playfair Display or Cormorant Garamond)

Body/meta: clean sans (e.g., Inter or Source Sans 3)
Hierarchy comes from spacing + size, not color.

Layout Changes
View 1: Closed Journal Landing (Cover)

Center a large closed journal cover (dark/charcoal leather texture).

Include:

“EntryOne”

“A Living Archive of Beginnings”

Button: “Open the Journal”

Add subtle realism: rounded corners, elastic band on right, soft shadow, bookmark ribbon at bottom.

Button should be cream with charcoal text, subtle hover.

View 2: Archive (After Open)

Replace the top folder tabs with a more journal/archival navigation:

Navigation Placement (Key change)

Use a left-side vertical index (like a filing cabinet index or archive labels).

Items: Archive, About, Mission, Contribute

It should be subtle, not heavy.

On mobile: index becomes a top horizontal scroll strip.

Archive Layout

Main area uses a calm cream background with gentle paper grain.

Keep search bar at top of the main area.

Keep a filter dropdown, but keep it minimal (monochrome styling).

Entry Cards: Picture-forward “Artifacts”

I want the archive cards to look like journal artifacts (polaroid/envelope/index card), inspired by scrapbook spreads.

Required behavior

Entries are generated dynamically from a JS array.

Each entry has an artifactType field that controls its look:

"polaroid"

"envelope"

"indexCard"

Each entry card should visually contain:

the artifact (CSS-generated, lightweight)

a caption area BELOW it (title, name, role)

a monochrome category label (no color coding)

a link button: “Open Entry ↗” that opens the Notion URL

Styling rules for artifacts

Polaroid: white frame, slight rotation, tape strip at top, subtle shadow.

Envelope: soft paper green or neutral paper tone is okay as the artifact itself (not the overall UI), with a small seal/star.

Index card: off-white card with faint lines and a clipped corner.

Keep the overall UI minimal; let the artifact be the visual element.

Featured Spread Section

Keep a “Featured Spread” section like a journal spread:

Left side: Envelope card labeled “LETTER TO YOUR FUTURE SELF”

Right side: Polaroid labeled “POLAROID PICTURE OF YOURSELF AT THE MOMENT”

Add a small handwritten-style caption under the polaroid: “live, create, tell the story”
This should look like a real spread: balanced whitespace, calm tones, subtle shadows.

Content + Data Model

In script.js, store entries like:

id

title

personName

role

category (Beginning / Pivot / Quiet Win)

artifactType (polaroid/envelope/indexCard)

notionUrl

date

Generate:

entry cards

search filtering (by title/name/role)

category filter

Include 6 sample entries.

Accessibility + Responsiveness

Keyboard: Enter key triggers “Open the Journal” when focused.

Focus outlines visible but tasteful.

Mobile:

Journal cover scales nicely.

Left index becomes top scroll nav.

Cards stack in 1 column.

Deliverables

index.html

styles.css

script.js

Clean, well-commented code.

No build step: static site runs immediately.

Also: remove any “Made with Replit” badge if possible.
